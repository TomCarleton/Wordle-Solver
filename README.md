# Wordle-Solver

A C# application for solving wordle puzzles, adapted from my previous console based python application.

To download and use the program, you'll only need to download 'Wordle Solve.exe'

I first adapted my previous python code to work as a console application in C#. Once everything was working identically to the previous application, I begun to design a UI using WinForms. Then I started to adapt the console application code to suit a WinForms application, which definitely isn't the most efficient way to do things, but it does the job. I decided not to use any templates for the UI, so everything you see is designed from scratch. There are a few places where I'd like to improve the code, such as the 'UpdateGrid' method which contains a lot of repetition, but overall it's much more presentable than the previous console versions.
